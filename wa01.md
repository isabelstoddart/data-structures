For this assignment, I started by following the instruction videos and using the sample code. I decided I wanted to challenge myself and use a loop to save all of the html files. 

I ran into some trouble here trying to figure out how to print each html file to a separate text file while using a loop. I tried using “/home/ec2-user/environment/AAMeetings/“ + toString(i) + “.text” to get the files to print to a new text file every time but this didn’t work. They still were printed to the same file and only the last file in the loop showed up. 

I tried making a second loop of output files to use in the for loop.  But I got a throw error. So, I ended up not using the loop and doing the requests 10 separate times.

I’m sure there is an easier way to do the loop, the only thing I need to figure out is how to print to a separate fs file for each request.

Overall, I thought this assignment was straight forward and easy the videos were helpful and easy to follow along.
