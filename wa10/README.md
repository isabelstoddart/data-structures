# Weekly Assignment 10
### For data structures at Parsons School of Design

The purpose of this assignment is to design interfaces for the three data sources we are using (AA, process blog, and sensors). I have included my interface designs below.

## AA Meetings

My visualization for the AA Meetings data will look like a map of manhattan using the design of apple maps and google maps (green for land, blue for water, white for streets). I want to use this design because these are the maps users typically use to get around and I want my map to be intuitive to the user. There will be dots on the map for each AA Meetings and when the user clicks on each dot a pop up box will appear with the group name, start time and end time of the meeting, address of the meeting, and the details, meeting type, and special interest of the meeting. There will be a search bar at the top where the user can select a day, a time, and/or a type of meeting which will result in only dots fitting those criteria showing up on the map. There will also be a "Show meetings nearby" button that shows the meetings near the users location at the time the user clicks the button, incase a user needs to go to a meeting right away. 

The lat and long will need to be mapped to each dot on the map. The day, type, and time will be mapped to the search bar and used to sort each meeting. The group name, start and end time, address, details, meeting type, and special interest will also need to be mapped to each dot.
