Code for weekly assignment 1 for data structures taken at Parsons School of Design. 

This code reads in provided urls and prints them out into text files. 

For this assignment, I started by following the instruction videos and using the sample code. I decided I wanted to challenge myself and use a loop to save all of the url files. 

I ran into some trouble here trying to figure out how to print each url file to a separate text file while using a loop. I tried using “/home/ec2-user/environment/AAMeetings/“ + toString(i) + “.text” to get the files to print to a new text file every time but this didn’t work. They still were printed to the same file and only the last file in the loop showed up. 

I tried making a second loop of output files to use in the for loop.  But I got a throw error. 

I think the issue is that the computer isn't reading in the files fast enough. It seems write file async needs to be used instead of write file sync and await needs to be incorporated somehow. I hope to learn how to do this so I can use a loop in the future.

Overall, I thought this assignment was straight forward and the videos were helpful and easy to follow.
