### Mockup

### Current State
![](stateAA.png)

The AA map currently defaults to meetings on Fridays after 5 PM. The tooltip popup includes the name of the group, the address, the start time, the end time, and the day.

### Next Steps
* Format the popup. The tooltip currently includes everything I want it to, but I want it to look nicer
* Make the default the actual day and time of when the user opens the visualization
* Allow user input to change the day, time, and type of meeting they are looking for
* Possibly change the design for the map and location pointers
